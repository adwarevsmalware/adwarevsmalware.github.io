Should You Consider Adware as Malware in Your Study?

### Abstract of the Paper

Empirical validations of research approaches eventually
require a curated ground truth. In studies related to
Android malware, such a ground truth is built by leveraging
Anti-Virus (AV) scanning reports which are often provided freely
through online services such as VirusTotal. Unfortunately, these
reports do not offer precise information for appropriately and
uniquely assigning classes to samples in app datasets: AV engines
indeed do not have a consensus on specifying information in
labels. Furthermore, labels often mix information related to
families, types, etc. In particular, the notion of “adware” is
currently blurry when it comes to maliciousness. There is thus a
need to thoroughly investigate cases where adware samples can
actually be associated to malware (e.g., because they are tagged
as adware but could be considered as malware as well).

In this work, we present a large-scale analytical study of
Android adware samples to quantify to what extent “adware
should be considered as malware”. Our analysis is based on
the Androzoo repository of 5 million apps with associated AV
labels, and leverages a state-of-the-art label harmonization tool
to infer the malicious type of apps before confronting it against
the ad families that each adware app is associated with. We found
that all adware families include samples that are actually known
to implement specific malicious behavior types. Up to 50% of
samples in an ad family could be flagged as malicious. Overall
the study demonstrates that adware is not necessarily benign.
